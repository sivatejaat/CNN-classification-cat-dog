# Dogs vs Cats Convolutional Neural Networks Classification




## Problem Statement

In this Code, we are implementing Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training is 2,000 and final testing is done on seperate 400 images.

### Dependencies

Jupyter Notebook

Tensorflow

Python 3.6

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Pandas

Numpy

### Test-Train Split

Image training set contain 2400 images for each category. I split those into 80% train and 20% means test Split each class images into 2000 for train and 400 for test.
